As we begin this meditation, I invite you to take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it, allowing any tension to dissipate.

As you exhale, repeat the phrase "I am calm" to yourself, letting the words sink deeply into your mind and heart. Allow any thoughts or worries to gently fade away, like clouds disappearing on a sunny day.

Imagine a warm light beginning to radiate from within, filling your entire being with a sense of peace and tranquility. As this light grows, it spreads throughout your body, soothing any areas that may be feeling tense or stressed.
