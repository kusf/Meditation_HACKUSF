# Meditation_HACKUSF

This application builds a scene from the prompts chosen by the user. Based on the prompts chosen, an AI will determine the mood of the response, and by extension the user, to create an image and a selection of music to create the ideal environment for growth and meditation.

This project showcases multiple AI running based off of each other all chaining off of one prompt generated by the previous iteration the AI created. Skills showcased by this project are
- Prompt Engineering
- Large Language Model (LLM) usage
- Using LLMs for a variety of purposes to create coherent responses
- Proper understanding of AI flow

## Requirements
To install python requirements
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run Ollama. Make the model from the MakeFile.  Make sure that you have qwen2.5 installed. Then serve.
```bash
ollama create model -f "backend/ModelFile" && ollama serve
```

To run the frontend, install Godot 4.4.1 Mono (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/4.4.1-stable/Godot_v4.4.1-stable_mono_win64.zip)
Open the project and run.

Note: The backend must be run first to generate the first prompt before the frontend would respond to it. Both must be running concurrently for communication to happen properly. If you're attempting to use this project on your own make sure to set the filepaths in both the backend and frontend properly.
