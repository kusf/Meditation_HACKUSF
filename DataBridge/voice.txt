As we begin this meditation, I invite you to take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel the air fill your lungs, and then slowly release it, allowing any tension to dissipate.

As you exhale, repeat the phrase "I am calm" to yourself, letting the words sink deeply into your mind and heart. Allow any thoughts or worries to gently fade away, like clouds disappearing on a sunny day.

Imagine a warm light beginning to radiate from within, filling your entire being with a sense of peace and tranquility. As this light grows, it spreads throughout your body, soothing any areas that may be feeling tense or stressed.

As you settle into this moment, bring your awareness to the sensation of your body resting comfortably. Let go of any tightness you may feel, and surrender to the present, knowing that you are safe and supported.

With each breath, feel yourself becoming more grounded and centered. Picture your breath as a wave, rising and falling gently, carrying away any distractions or concerns that may be lingering in your mind.

Now, imagine a serene garden where each flower represents a positive thought or intention. As you walk through the garden, take a moment to admire the beauty around you, and allow yourself to feel grateful for all that is well in your life.

As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize a soft breeze brushing against your skin, calming your senses and inviting a sense of ease into your body and mind. Let this peaceful feeling wash over you, knowing that it is always within reach.
